**Description:** 
gen_graph.py generates fancy graphs from files in serializable [NetworkX json format].
These json files are read from the 'dots' directory. All files in this directory need to
have the extension '.dot.json'.

To get started there are a few examples in the 'dots' directory. Familiarity with graphviz
is pretty important too. The NetworkX documentation is pretty amazing so check it out.
